# Sure, here is how you can create a cryptocurrency on the blockchain that I just created:

# Create a new file called cryptocurrency.py.
# In the cryptocurrency.py file, create a class called Cryptocurrency.
# The Cryptocurrency class should have the following attributes:
# name: The name of the cryptocurrency.
# symbol: The symbol of the cryptocurrency.
# total_supply: The total supply of the cryptocurrency.
# decimals: The number of decimal places for the cryptocurrency.
# The Cryptocurrency class should also have the following methods:
# get_balance(address): This method should return the balance of the cryptocurrency at the given address.
# send(from_address, to_address, amount): This method should send the given amount of cryptocurrency from the from_address to the to_address.
# Once you have created the Cryptocurrency class, you can create instances of it to represent different cryptocurrencies.
# To mine cryptocurrency on the blockchain, you can use the mine_block() method on the Blockchain class.
# Once you have mined a block, you will be rewarded with cryptocurrency.
# Here is an example of how to create a cryptocurrency on the blockchain:


import blockchain


class Cryptocurrency(object):
    def __init__(self, name, symbol, total_supply, decimals):
        self.name = name
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.total_supply = total_supply
        self.decimals = decimals

    def get_balance(self, address):
        return blockchain.get_balance(address, self.symbol)

    def send(self, from_address, to_address, amount):
        blockchain.send(from_address, to_address, amount, self.symbol)


my_cryptocurrency = Cryptocurrency("My Cryptocurrency", "MC", 1000000, 10)

# Mine a block
blockchain.mine_block()

# Check the balance of my account
my_balance = my_cryptocurrency.get_balance("my_address")

# Send some cryptocurrency to another account
my_cryptocurrency.send("my_address", "another_address", 100)

# Check the balance of the other account
another_balance = my_cryptocurrency.get_balance("another_address")
